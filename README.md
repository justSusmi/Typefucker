# Typefucker
This is the Software which automaticaly fucks the website Typewriter.at

Go to settings.txt and type your info like this:

1.username \n
2.password
3.max letters to write in 10 minutes
4.min letters to write in 10 minutes
5.how much units to write

In case you're wondering why I used maximum/minimum letters per 10 minutes, the TypeWriter website also uses this unit. So it's the best method to write a task legitimately and then set the speed range.
There will soon be an update where you can add as many mistakes as you want to avoid being detected. If you got any serious questions, just inform me on discord(susmi)
