# Typefucker
This is the Software which automaticaly fucks the website Typewriter.at

Install Python

Execute install.bat

Now you can use Typefucker

In case you're wondering why I used maximum/minimum letters per 10 minutes, the TypeWriter website also uses this unit. So it's the best method to write a task legitimately and then set the speed range.
There will soon be an update where you can add as many mistakes as you want, to avoid being detected. If you got any serious questions, just inform me on discord (susmi)
